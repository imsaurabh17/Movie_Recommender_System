# Movie Recommendation System

This project aims to simplify the process of finding movies you love. By selecting a single movie, users are presented with five similar movies, making it easier to discover new favorites. This system leverages various Python libraries to analyze movie data and find meaningful recommendations based on user preferences.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have a Python environment set up. You'll also need to install some specific libraries. This project assumes you have any Python-supported tools like Jupyter, VS Code, or PyCharm installed. If not, please install one of these before proceeding.

First, install Python if you haven't already. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

How It Works
The system takes a movie name as input from the user. It then processes this input to find and recommend five similar movies based on genres, descriptions, and other relevant factors. The recommendations are generated using a combination of content-based filtering techniques, leveraging the CountVectorizer for text features and various similarity metrics.

### Installing

To get your development environment running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-link-here.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd movie-recommendation-system
Install the required libraries using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk streamlit requests pickle5
Note: This command installs all the necessary libraries like numpy, pandas, scikit-learn for machine learning models, nltk for natural language processing tasks, streamlit for web app development, requests for HTTP requests in Python, and pickle for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure.
Running the Application
To run the application on your local machine, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Replace app.py with the path to your Streamlit application script. This command will start a web server and open the application in your default web browser.
